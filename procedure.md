• Do the connection as per the circuit diagram.


• Keep the varia in the zero position and switch on the power supply.


• 2 Increase the varia voltage slowly until the fluorescent tube flickers and
glows. Measure the current, voltage, and power.


• Take another 4 sets of ammeter, voltmeter, and wattmeter reading at
different positions of varia while the tube is glowing.


• Record the reading in observation table.


• Switch off the power supply.
